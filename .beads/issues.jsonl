`allow|deny|require_human`\n  - `reason_code`\n  - `evidence_refs[]`\n- `interhub` presents approval UI for `require_human` and writes decision via command API.\n\n## Error + Compatibility Contract\n- Error envelope:\n  - `code`, `message`, `retryable`, `details`, `trace_id`.\n- Versioning:\n  - Additive fields are backward-compatible.\n  - Breaking changes require `/v2` endpoint and event `schema_version` bump.\n  - `interhub` must ignore unknown fields.\n\n## Non-Goals (v1)\n- No direct plugin-to-UI coupling.\n- No UI-owned business rules.\n- No cross-run global ordering guarantees.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria for this contract phase\n- Interhub can render: portfolio, project control room, agent fleet, exceptions solely from intercore APIs/events.\n- Human gate approvals flow end-to-end using `decision.required` -\u003e command -\u003e `decision.resolved`.\n- A module can be swapped/disabled without interhub code changes if event/API contract remains valid.\n\n## Desired Destination State\n- `intercore` is the platform kernel for autonomous orchestration across tools, not a Claude Code-only plugin bundle.\n- `interhub` is a separate lifecycle UX component (Slack-like TUI/control room) that ships by default with `intercore` but remains replaceable.\n- `inter-*` modules remain composable, generalized capabilities that integrate through `intercore` contracts.\n- `clavain` is the opinionated rig/profile on top of generalized modules (presets, policies, defaults), not the platform kernel.\n- The system supports portfolio-scale operation: multiple agents across multiple projects through one lifecycle control plane from brainstorm to ship.\n\n## OpenClaw-Inspired Direction (Adapted for Interverse)\nThe target architecture is inspired by OpenClaw-style platform patterns while remaining Interverse-native:\n- Manifest-first plugin model with strict schema validation at load time.\n- Explicit plugin capability boundaries and ownership semantics (including optional exclusive slot ownership where needed).\n- Headless control plane + optional/default UX clients.\n- Runtime adapters so Claude Code is one client, not a hard dependency.\n- Event-driven orchestration with deterministic policy decisions and auditable state transitions.\n- Clear separation between platform substrate (`intercore`), capabilities (`inter-*`), and product opinion (`clavain`).\n\n## Why This Matters\n- Reduces coupling to any single AI host runtime.\n- Increases autonomy for long-running multi-agent workflows.\n- Preserves module composability while allowing strong opinionated distributions.\n- Enables future clients (CLI/web/TUI/other hosts) to share the same orchestration kernel.\n\n## Explicit Non-Goals for This Direction\n- `interhub` is not a source of truth for workflow state; `intercore` remains authoritative.\n- `clavain` is not merged into `intercore` and does not bypass platform contracts.\n- This is not a single mega-plugin merge of all inter modules into one inseparable artifact.","acceptance_criteria":"- Destination-state architecture (intercore/interhub/inter-modules/clavain) is documented and decision-complete\n- intercore↔interhub API + event bus contract is documented with versioning and compatibility rules\n- Responsibilities and boundaries are explicit (no UI source-of-truth, no Clavain bypass of platform contracts)\n- Phased rollout/migration plan is documented with risks and rollback strategy\n- Module composability is preserved while enabling default-shipped lifecycle UX","notes":"Architecture decision complete (design doc populated).

If fd-performance and fd-quality have overlapping focus areas for this artifact, merge or skip one. After first round of outputs, prune agents that produced no actionable findings before a potential second pass.\n\nAlso relates to trust-weighted triage (iv-ynbh) — low-precision agents are redundancy candidates.\n\nImplementation: Add post-triage redundancy filter in flux-drive skill.
