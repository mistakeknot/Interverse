# Close Superseded Integration Beads

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Operator:** Claude Code (Haiku 4.5)

## Task

Close 8 beads from the cross-module integration program (iv-z1a0 through iv-z1a7) that are superseded by the Intercore vision document's kernel event bus, cross-project relay, and portfolio-level runs design.

## Results

All 8 beads closed successfully with exit code 0.

| Bead ID | Status | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| iv-z1a0 | Closed | Superseded by intercore vision: kernel event bus + cross-project coordination + portfolio runs |
| iv-z1a1 | Closed | Superseded by intercore vision: kernel event bus + cross-project coordination + portfolio runs |
| iv-z1a2 | Closed | Superseded by intercore vision: kernel event bus + cross-project coordination + portfolio runs |
| iv-z1a3 | Closed | Superseded by intercore vision: kernel event bus + cross-project coordination + portfolio runs |
| iv-z1a4 | Closed | Superseded by intercore vision: kernel event bus + cross-project coordination + portfolio runs |
| iv-z1a5 | Closed | Superseded by intercore vision: kernel event bus + cross-project coordination + portfolio runs |
| iv-z1a6 | Closed | Superseded by intercore vision: kernel event bus + cross-project coordination + portfolio runs |
| iv-z1a7 | Closed | Superseded by intercore vision: kernel event bus + cross-project coordination + portfolio runs |

**Total:** 8/8 succeeded, 0 errors.

## Rationale

The Intercore vision document defines a kernel-level event bus, cross-project coordination relay, and portfolio-level run tracking that subsumes what these cross-module integration beads were tracking. Closing them with a clear supersession reason preserves audit trail while cleaning up the bead board.
